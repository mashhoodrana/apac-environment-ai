# Integration Notes

## Changes Made to Merge Frontend and Backend

### Frontend Changes

1. Created a frontend API service (`FrontEnd/src/services/api.js`) to interact with the backend API.
2. Updated React components to fetch real data:
   - NDVI.js: Modified to fetch and display NDVI data
   - Temperature.js: Modified to fetch and display temperature data
   - Albedo.js: Modified to fetch data and display estimated albedo values

3. Added Docker configuration for the frontend:
   - Created `FrontEnd/Dockerfile` for containerization
   - Added `FrontEnd/nginx.conf` to proxy API requests to the backend

### Backend Changes

1. The backend already had proper CORS configuration, so no changes were needed to accept requests from the frontend.
2. Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include both services.

### Docker Configuration

1. Updated `docker-compose.yml` to define both services:
   - `api`: The FastAPI backend
   - `frontend`: The React frontend served with Nginx

2. Setup reverse proxy with Nginx to route API requests from the frontend to the backend.

### Convenience Scripts

1. Created startup scripts for easy deployment:
   - `start-app.sh` for Linux/macOS users
   - `start-app.bat` for Windows users

2. Added `setup.py` for development environment setup.

### Documentation

1. Updated README.md with comprehensive instructions for running both services.
2. Added documentation on how to run the services for both development and production.

## Special Features

1. **Albedo Approximation**: Since the backend doesn't directly provide albedo measurements, created an approximation algorithm based on NDVI values.
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the frontend works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. **Health Checks**: Implemented health check for the backend service to ensure reliability.

## Deployment Notes

1. The application is configured to run in a Docker environment, making it easy to deploy on any platform that supports Docker.
2. The frontend and backend are completely decoupled, communicating only through the API.
3. Environment-specific configuration is handled through environment variables.

## Future Improvements

1. Add user authentication for personalized experiences.
2. Implement caching for satellite data to improve performance.
3. Add more detailed visualizations (maps, charts, etc.).
4. Expand to additional environmental parameters.
5. Add automated tests for both frontend and backend components.
